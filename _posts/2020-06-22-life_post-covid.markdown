This is a short blog, however it feels like I have been writing it for a long time.
Blogs are meant to help you in your Flatiron journey and with so many things going on around the world we can all agree we need some time to rest. 
I think writing my feelings will help me with my struggles as a human being. 
After being hit with Covid-19 I am still looking to properly recover from it. 
My endurance for normal walks has gone to the floor, I can only do short walks of 10 mins. 
I can't dance more than 2 songs in a row, or even cycle for 5 mins. 
My lungs were destroyed by the virus and where there was no pain before all I feel is Pain Pain Pain! 
I'm keeping a positive mind and coding distracts me from it but then you close your eyes everything comes back! 
I have survived the virus, but I have just won one battle and this war has just started. 
I will look back when I finish this course and be proud of myself and be thankful for all the wonderful people that have helped me! 
My advice for everyone out there suffering the same consequences, I say, keep strong and write a blog.
