My passion for data started when I finished university. I went to work for a company that mostly managed data in pure SQL and some higher programming in PLSQL. I started to get a glimpse of how data work, but I always felt that could be more than what it is.

A year later down the line I wasn't sure what to do anymore, I was not enjoying my job as much as I used to but I still like the idea behind data being more important to companies than it was. I started looking online about data and Data Science came up, I researched for a long time about it and what really picked my interest was that data science is being used by Hedge Funds to make faster and more accurate decisions in investing.

The following days, I read a few articles and it intrigued me so much that I went to codeacademy and signed up for the Data Science path. I have been working on Data Science ever since but when I came across Flatiron, I knew this was the place where I wanted to learn. 

Fast forward a few months and I have gotten accepted and I'm working on my first final project of module 1. Lucky for me the project is about the movie industry. 

I am now able to manage data using pandas, create visualizations using Seaborn and most importantly I'm seeing the real effects of using data. 

I am looking forward to learn more Data Science techniques, improve my coding and learn more about algorithms. I want to be able to use it for my personal life, such as in personal investments and also apply it for work. 

Data Science is not a career, is a way of life.
